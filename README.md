## Database

For this project we received 4 different datasets. Here is a small overview of the information contained in these files:

- Assets to be delivered: Excel file with every purchase made on the company's website
- Types of vehicles that can be used:
  - Name of the model
  - Gasoline consumption
  - Maximum load capacity
- Product catalog:
  - Product category
  - Name of the product
  - Code
  - Volume
- Distribution Centers' locations (For this project we have focused solely in Monterrey)
  - Name of the distribution center
  - Location, both address and coordinates

## Data cleaning

For the purposes of working with these databases we adopted the common library [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)

### Geo-coding addresses

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

- Mentioning how the usage of Photon as a geocoder seriously limits the number of addresses that are geocoded successfully.
- Purchasing a Google Maps comercial API key to improve both the performance and speed of the geocoding process.
